# What you will find here
A lot of tutorials, guides or blog posts teach you how to do the same things over and over again like a todo-app or a too easy example.
Very often they don't fit with a real implementation or a real world application.
In this repo you can find a lot of project ideas that you can use to learn something in a different way: try to do something really close to a real world project.

Many of the projects and good intentions fail because you don't have the ideas to begin with. or rather sometimes we don't have any idea for a new project at all.

This repo can help you to find a good example to learn something new for your next project at work.
All projects are compatible to be best used with React, Angular or Blazor.
