# Password Generator Website

A website to quickly and easily create passwords with different levels of security.

## Goal
Create a one-page website without any registration or private area where the user can create a new secure password with a lot of security settings (lenght, special characters, prefix or suffix, ...).

---

## Level 1 🦄
Add the basic functionalities for the website.
A textbox with the generated password.
A slide for the password length setting.
Four checkboxes to add or remove: characters with uppercase, characters with lowercase, numbers and special characters.

## Level 2 🦄🦄
Add a button to copy the generated password to the clipboard and a button to restart to generate a new password.
It would be great to have a list of all generated password below the settings section.

## Level 3 🦄🦄🦄
Check if the password is in the database breaches "have i been pwned".
The API is not free and requires a fee of 3.5$ each month.
